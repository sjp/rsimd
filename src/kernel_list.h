/* The kernel slots of struct rsimd_kernels, one line per op/type pair:
 *
 *   RSIMD_OP(slot_name, return_type, (argument list))
 *
 * This file has no include guard: it is included repeatedly with different
 * definitions of RSIMD_OP to generate the function pointer types, the struct
 * members, the slot names and every tier's table (src/dispatch.h,
 * src/kernels/table.inc.c). Adding an op is one line here plus the kernel
 * body, RSIMD_KERNEL(slot_name), in a kernels/<family>.inc.c file.
 *
 * Every tier must define each slot's kernel, except that a kernel source may
 * write `#define RSIMD_SKIP_<slot_name> 1` to leave the slot empty in that
 * tier (an op with no useful SIMD version, or one not written yet); the
 * dispatcher then uses the next tier down. The none tier cannot skip slots.

/* Internal slots. tier_name returns the id of the tier the kernel was

   tier it is always filled from below. Both are used by the tests of the
